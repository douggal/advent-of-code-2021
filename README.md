My solutions to the Advent of Code December 2021

Advent of Code Website:  [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com)

My solution to each day's puzzles.  In Scala 3 unless otherwise noted.

1. Day  1: Sonar Sweep
2. Day  2: Dive!
3. Day  3: Binary Diagnostic
4. Day  4: Giant Squid

### Notes
#### Day 01
Off to a good start.

#### Day 03
I found today's puzzle harder to solve than it first appeared to be.  
If I have time and inclination I'll revisit and 
try to reduce the number of for loops by replacing with functional method calls.  
Is there a way to avoid nested loops (maybe a built-in transpose function)?

#### Day 04
Completed Part Two at 3 minutes before midnight on the 4th.  I made two mistakes: 1) somehow
typed in a "1" to first number line 1 of data in the file when saving the puzzle input, 
and 2) for part two I did not reload the data after part 1 completed.
